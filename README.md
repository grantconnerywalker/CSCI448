To assist with grading, here we're going to talk about which of the 10 parts we managed to complete:

1. Complete!
2. Complete!
3. A graph button exists and it does segue to a new MVC, but no actual graphing occurs (this stems mostly from
our unable to wrestle GraphViewController.m into submission).
4. A space for this exists, but is not filled in with the mentioned 'program'.
5. Graphing view successfully displays the axes of the graph, but not the plot.
6. Complete!
7. Complete! (though we were unable to properly test it due to GraphViewController.m giving us trouble)
8. It shows up on iPad, which is good, however none of the buttons function, which is less good.
9. Rotation not supported anywhere.
10. Not attempted. 

We would have liked to complete more, but there was some fundamental difficulty we had managing everything. We
still put in quite a bit of time on it (close to 30 hours, we imagine) but were unfortunately unable to finish
every part of the project.
